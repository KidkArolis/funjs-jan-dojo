# London FunctionalJS January Dojo, 2014

These are the notes and projects from the London FunctionalJS January
Dojo, 2014. The script from my demo is in `intro.cljs`. The `todo`
folder contains a skeleton for implementing a simple TODO app.

There are three project ideas for this Dojo:

- Implement a fully functional TODO app from the skeleton.
- Go through David Nolen's
  [Light Table ClojureScript tutorial](https://github.com/swannodette/lt-cljs-tutorial)
- Go through some of the exercises on
  [4clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/). This does not require you to
  install anything on your system.

Happy hacking!
